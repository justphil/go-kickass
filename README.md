# Go Kickass
Go Kickass is an integration of de facto standard Go packages that allows you to rapidly bootstrap a rock solid web app.

## Background
The idea is that you can fork this repository every time you need to start a new web project. I've done a thorough research to find all these packages when I started to learn Go back in late 2014. I studied their source code and wanted to make sure that they are of high quality, in particular focusing on aspects like:

* Are they written in an idiomatic way?
* Do they take into account performance considerations?
* Do they solve one particular problem in a concise way without being to bloated?
* Do they provide a satisfying test coverage?
* Are they still maintained?
* Do they complement Go's standard lib without reinventing the wheel?

## Integrations

TBD
